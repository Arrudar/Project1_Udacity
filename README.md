"# Project1_Udacity" 

Deliverable of the first project on Becoming a Data Science (Udacity Program):

1) Pick a dataset (Stack Overflow Data).

2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used (Understand DS market in Brazil).

3) Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to :

4) Communicate your business insights (Medium - separete deliverable):

On this project I try to understand the opportunities to became a DS in Brazil trought the data provided by Stack Overflow annual survey.

Key Questions and Findings:


1) How is the market for DSs in Brazil compared with other countries (#N of DSs over time using # of respondents as a proxy to the number of DSs on the market)
    
    #Good indications that the market for DS is growing in Brazil YoY
        #Significant increase in the number of respondents in Brazil from 2017-1018
        #Small decrease from 2018-2019, but in line with other countries (hipothesis that this survey was less promoted in 2019)
        
    #Brazil have a huge gap of #N DSs to fill when comparing with the benchmark (we should expect a growth on the number of DS on comming years)
        #Brazil has less than 3% of total respondents, losing for countries with much less population (e.g. UK, Canada, Germany) 
        #More developed countries (e.g. US, Germany and UK) have much more respondents

2) How is the salary and job satisfaction of Brazillian DSs

    #~68% DS are satisfied with their career (2019)
      #This sounds robust since 2018 (~66%) and 2019 (~78%)  
    
    #Those who have a significant salary (+35k/year) use to be satisfied with their careers 
      #2017: DS with salarys of +35K/ year has almost all graded 6 or more on career satisfaction;
      #2018 and 2019: DS with salarys of +35K/ year rarely position theirselves as dissatisfied on their careers;

3) How is the 'typical' Brazillian DS Profile? (Experience Level and Formal Education)

    #Most of DSs in Brazil (85%) have some sort of formal/ 'superior' education (i.e. BA or Master)
    
    #Most of Brazillian DSs have are young/ have not much time on the field (Years of Coding) 
        #In 2019 most of respondends ~45% have 6 years or less coding
    
    #Looks like there is other factors than YearsCoding that can determine how good will be the salary for Brazillian DSs
        #Very weak correlation between YearsCoding and Salary
        #For 2019, visual shows that there is a concentration of DSs making ~U$20K/ year or less
        #DSs making more than U$20K/ year are very scatter regarding YearsCoding
